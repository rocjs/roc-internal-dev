# roc-internal-dev [![Travis][build-badge]][build] [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

Internal tool for building Roc extensions.

## How to use
Add this module as a dev dependency to the Roc extension that you want to manage. Then you can connect npm scripts to the commands that this module exposes.

You can use the short name `rid` as an alternative to `roc-internal-dev` if you don't want to write out the entire name.

```js
"scripts": {
    "build": "rid build",
    // ...
}
```

### Tip
A useful tip is to add an alias to rid that makes it easier to work with in the project.

```js
"scripts": {
    "start": "rid",
    // ...
}
```

It is then possible to run all possible commands using `npm start <command>`.

## Get correct documentation
It is important to add the extension itself to the `package.json` for `roc-internal-dev` to be able to generate documentation.

__Example__
```json
{
  "name": "roc-package-module",
  ...
  "roc": {
    "packages": [
      "./lib/index.js"
    ]
  }
}
```
